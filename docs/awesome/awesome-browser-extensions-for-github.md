OctoPermalinker is a browser extension that searches GitHub comments/files for links to files on branches, and adds a link to where the branch pointed when the comment/file was made/updated. This helps you avoid following a link that was broken after being posted. For context, here's some discussion about broken GitHub links: [Don't link to line numbers in GitHub](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8046710).

For example, suppose you're looking at a gist that links to a file on the master branch of a repo. At the time the gist was made, the link worked, but if the file gets removed, the link is broken. OctoPermalinker uses the gist creation date to add a permalink that still works.
